# -Methods-for-the-RNA-secondary-structure-prediction-problem

This repository contains the code used for the "Methods for the RNA secondary structure prediction problem" end grade project paper.
Due to the size of the code repository, this repository is paired with a google drive mirror, that will contain all the heavy folders.
Should a folder only have a .gitignore with the following code:

```git
*
*/
!.gitignore
```
That means the contents are in the mirror drive repository, and that folders content should be downloaded from there. Warning, the contents may be heavy.

Link to the mirror repository: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sJs4bdFaGO_IuxBzcEsUrUQW5EkEAyYL?usp=sharing

As sugested in the end grade project paper, the notebooks with A LOT more stats can be found in code/model_stadistics/. 
These should work without needing to download anything from the mirror repository.

As mentioned before, this repository is shown as it is, as a proof of thr work done, not necesarily being a runnable app. Playing around with the code may not yield the same results as those showcased on the paper.
